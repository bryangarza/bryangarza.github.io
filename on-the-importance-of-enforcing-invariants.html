Something that comes up early on when learning OCaml is the topic of abstract
types. Comparable to &ldquo;encapsulation&rdquo; in object-oriented programming, one purpose
of abstract types is to protect the programmer from misusing a module&rsquo;s
types. By abstracting the type, for example, presenting a <code>Number.t</code> instead of a
plain <code>int</code> type, the underlying implementation can be swapped out, without
affecting code using the module. Only by using the module can the user create a
value of that type, because only the module knows that <code>Number.t = int</code>, and has
ability to create that type.
</p>

<p>
Abstract types guarantee that the user can never access the concrete type
directly This is known as &ldquo;enforcing invariants&rdquo;, preserving certain properties
about the type, so that you can now assume they will always be true, i.e.,
<i>invariant</i>.  Placing this restriction on library users increases the level of
type safety significantly.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, sometimes you <i>do</i> want to have concrete types in your
interface, and that&rsquo;s okay too. It gives more flexibility to the user, since
they can construct those types by hand, and have more detail about the internals
of the module.
