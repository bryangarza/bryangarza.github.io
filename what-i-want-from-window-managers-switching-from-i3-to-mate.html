</p>

<p>
I decided to try and switch to a different window manager, namely because I was
tired of switching to the wrong workspace in i3. Even though I for the most part
put the same applications on the same workspaces each time, I still spend too
much time fumbling with which workspace I want. I tend to want at most 2 windows
in view, usually as split columns. Occasionally I&rsquo;ll want 3 windows visible at
once, but for the most part my workflow is having one or two visible
windows. I&rsquo;ve put up with i3&rsquo;s manual layouts for years, mostly because its
<a href="https://i3wm.org/i3bar/">i3bar</a> supports system applets out-of-the-box and it&rsquo;s too much effort to set up
another window manager to work similarly, effort that could be spend working on
something more productive.
</p>

<p>
Before I get into more detail, here&rsquo;s some background on what window managers or
desktop environments I&rsquo;ve used:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>GNOME 3: Sophomore year of high school I began to use Ubuntu</li>
<li>XFCE: I remember at some point I switched to Xubuntu</li>
<li>dwm: During junior year of high school, I switched to Arch Linux</li>
<li>xmonad: I dabbled in this one for a few months as well</li>
<li>i3wm: By the end of junior year I had switched to i3 for what I then
considered to be &ldquo;sane&rdquo; multi-monitor support</li>
<li>Aqua: Throughout college I used OS X (this was before I understood the gravity
and importance of privacy)</li>
<li>i3wm: I came back to using GNU/Linux a few months after finishing school, and
naturally gravitated back to the last window manager I had used</li>
<li>MATE: As of writing this post, I&rsquo;ve switched to a floating window manager,
after analyzing my usual workflow</li>
</ul>

<p>
During the time that I used dwm/xmonad/i3 in high school, I was active in the
Arch Linux forums, as well as the <code>#archlinux</code> IRC channel. Back then, I was still
learning to program and spent much of my time ricing my setup. As time went on
and I became a decent programmer, I realized how I just wanted things to work
correctly without fiddling, and that spending hours tweaking color schemes and
other settings was a waste of my time. Furthermore, using OS X was a total 180
from what I was previously used to, which required writing scripts for
everything and manually binding to various keys, as well as manually triggering
<code>arandr</code> commands to change my monitor layouts, etc.
</p>

<p>
When I switched back to GNU/Linux last year I knew that I wanted to maintain the
level of ease that is in OS X, at least for the essentials. One of those thing
is the use of <code>alt-tab</code>. This doesn&rsquo;t really seem to be available in any tiling
window managers. I started using <a href="https://davedavenport.github.io/rofi/">rofi</a> as a wannabe alt-tab switcher, but
disliked having to type the beginning of a window&rsquo;s name to switch to it.
</p>

<p>
One thing that drives me nuts to configure is status bars and applet trays. I
really don&rsquo;t see the point in setting them up, and tiling window managers that
ship without a decent status bar get a hard pass from me.
</p>

<p>
My requirements, therefore, for switching to another window manager or desktop
environment are that (1) there has to be an alt-tab switcher, (2) the status bar
has to work out-of-the-box and support applets.
</p>

<p>
Having heard of <a href="https://mate-desktop.org/">MATE</a> from a friend, I decided to give it a shot. First I
installed the most minimal package from the Debian repositories, but then
realized that even the full install didn&rsquo;t include that many extras. I also
installed <code>mate-tweak</code> to be able to change some extra settings.
</p>

<p>
The switch was also catalyzed by having read <a href="http://xahlee.info/linux/why_tiling_window_manager_sucks.html">Why Tiling Window Manager Sucks</a> by
Xah Lee. I&rsquo;ve always respected his expertise on emacs, ergonomics, and general
GNU/Linux usage, and it got me thinking that perhaps I was taking the wrong
approach to window management, too chord-centric and complicated for what should
require a minimal number of window manager actions, namely split left, split
right, maximize window, close window, and rotate to next application.
</p>

<p>
I removed most of the default MATE bindings, bound some of the Function keys to
the previously mentioned most common window manager actions, and set up <a href="http://xahlee.info/linux/linux_add_keyboard_shortcuts_to_switch_to_app.html">wmctrl
to switch to specific applications</a>. I also tried out Compiz for about an hour
but it seemed buggy to me so I quickly went back to the &ldquo;Marco (Compton GPU
Compositor)&rdquo; setting.
</p>

<p>
So far, my current setup is basically how I use <a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com/">Spectacle</a> on OS X, but without
using as many chords. Like I mentioned earlier, all I really want is to be able
to put emacs on the left half, and either Chromium or urxvt on the right. For
less used applications, I want to alt-tab to them. Simple as that. I don&rsquo;t need
the tiling (manual or automatic), because if I&rsquo;m working on the x230, I don&rsquo;t
have much screen real estate anyways, and if I&rsquo;m using the external monitor,
well, I still don&rsquo;t want to have more than 2 or 3 visible windows.
</p>

<p>
One unexpected side effect of switching to MATE is that monitors automatically
work when plugged in. For i3, what I do is create an arandr script for each
specific setup (HDMI only, HDMI with ThinkPad monitor on left, living room TV
with ThinkPad on right, etc), and then launch said script with rofi. It&rsquo;s not
ideal, and sometimes X freaks out on me and I get a black screen, forcing me to
switch to another tty to kill the X server. I don&rsquo;t know if MATE will also have
similar issues but at least when I plug in my external monitor, it&rsquo;s
automatically enabled and the placement is saved. When I unplug the external
monitor, it works like it should, changing to only use the ThinkPad monitor, and
when the ThinkPad is closed and I disconnect the monitor, the ThinkPad goes to
sleep like it should.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m still using <a href="https://i3wm.org/i3lock/">i3lock</a> (it seems to work on any WM or DE without having to touch
it).
</p>

<p>
The monitor support in MATE (or any other Desktop Environment, I&rsquo;m assuming) is
enough reason to switch from a tiling window manager, or to switch to a
combination of Desktop Environment plus tiling wm. It&rsquo;s 2017, no one should be
using a tiling window manager standalone.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve only had this setup for a day, and therefore haven&rsquo;t fully explored the
pros and cons of i3 vs MATE (or tiling window managers vs Desktop Environments
in the large); later on I might write a follow-up post, but for now, these are
my first impressions.
