Last month I went to the CHON concert in SF with a friend. <a href="http://tricot.tv/">Tricot</a> is my favorite
band and there was no way I was going to miss the chance to see them live. It
was an amazing show. Tricot&rsquo;s set was a bit short but they played some of my
favorite songs including <b>18,19</b>. Being in a crowd where everyone is immersed in
the music is a strange feeling, like when you get shivers down your
spine. Towards the end of the concert we went to buy some merch and Tricot was
there, so I met them and we took a picture together. Really surprised that even
happened, isn&rsquo;t it rare for bands to just hang out after their set?

Next, I want to see <a href="http://www.motfd.com/">Mass of the Fermenting Dregs</a>. They just released a new album
(titled <i>No New World</i>) after 8 years. It&rsquo;s so damn good x_x. Hopefully I can
catch a show when I visit Japan.
