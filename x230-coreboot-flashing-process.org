I flashed [[https://www.coreboot.org][coreboot]] onto my x230, using a Raspberry Pi Model B Rev 2.0. These are
the resources I used (other than the coreboot wiki):

There are 2 ways to provide power to the BIOS chip. One way is to enable
Wake-On-LAN on the existing BIOS and connect the AC adapter and an Ethernet
cable; the computer should then supply 3.3V to the chip. However, I was unable
to get that working, so instead I connected the Pi's pin #17 to pin #8 of the
Macronix chip ([[http://html.alldatasheet.com/html-pdf/575458/MCNIX/MX25L3208EM2I12G/1149/7/MX25L3208EM2I12G.html][spec sheet]]).

Disassembly was dead-easy, though for next time, I ordered some plastic pry
tools. Since I couldn't read the chip's model (too much glue residue), I read
each of the four possible chips 3 times each, just in case. In hindsight, before
putting everything back together I could've used the [[https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner][me_cleaner]] script to remove
the Intel ME firmware from the flash chip. Right now =flashrom= reports that the
Management Region is locked, meaning I'll have to do another hardware flash to
get rid of it (there are some cases where this region has read/write permissions
and you can just do an internal flash).

Since flashing, I've had no issues, everything is working perfectly. I bought a
7260 ac card to replace my dog slow Centrino Wireless-N 2200 (since there's no
whitelist anymore).
