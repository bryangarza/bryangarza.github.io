I've been writing a desktop application that uses OCaml for the backend, and
Racket for the GUI frontend. To communicate between the two, I call the OCaml
program as a subprocess from Racket, and have s-expressions be the serialization
mechanism that both languages can understand. Jane Street's [[https://github.com/janestreet/core][Core]], along with the
=sexplib= syntax extension mentioned in my previous post, offer an easy way to
translate OCaml types to sexps that Racket can then read.

With a type like:
#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
type book = {
  title        : string;
  authors      : string list;
  pubdate      : string;
  publishers   : string list;
  subjects     : string list
} with sexp
#+END_SRC

A ~sexp_of_book~ function is automatically generated.

Now racket can receive:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
'((title "Purely functional data structures")
  (authors ("Chris Okasaki"))
  (pubdate 1999)
  (publishers ("Cambridge University Press"))
  (subjects ("Functional programming languages" "Data structures (Computer science)")))
#+END_SRC

I take this sexp, and create a =book= struct:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(struct book (title authors pubdate publishers subjects))

(define (isbn-lookup isbn)
  (let* ([hl "~/code/ocaml/homelib/homelib.native"]
         [cmd (string-join (list hl isbn))]
         [aux (with-output-to-string (Î» () (system cmd)))]
         [sp (open-input-string aux)] ; string port
         [res (read sp)]
         [data (map (lambda (x) (cadr x)) res)])
    (apply book data)))
#+END_SRC

Finally, we can test it out on the REPL to make sure it works:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
racket@app.rkt> (isbn-lookup "0521663504")
#<book>

racket@app.rkt> (book-title (isbn-lookup "0521663504"))
"Purely functional data structures"

racket@app.rkt> (book-subjects (isbn-lookup "0521663504"))
'("Functional programming languages" "Data structures (Computer science)")
#+END_SRC

Similarly, I can work in the other direction, and pass Racket s-expressions to
OCaml, and using sexplib, convert them back to OCaml types. What a time to be
alive!
